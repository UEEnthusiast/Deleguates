# Deleguates
Develop a custom async node in C++ for Unreal Engine 5 that detects when an Actor's Boolean value has changed, and subsequently destroys the listening Actor. 
The Actors can be represented as Cubes, Spheres, or any other shape as an example. Utilize event dispatchers to detect the Boolean value change without relying on tick events or timers.
